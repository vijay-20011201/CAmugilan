        <p>An essential tool that aids the saving of an individual is the Employees Provident Fund (EPF).</p>
        <p>Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) of India manages the Provident Funds of the Employees under the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act of 1952. Once an institution employs twenty or more employees, it becomes necessary to get a PF Registration. The PF fund contributes 12% of basic salary plus DA plus retaining allowance by employee and employer.</p>
        <p>We at MKDA assist you in registering PF as per individual needs.</p>

      <div class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed space-y-4 text-justify">
        <p>EPF registration is mandatory for the following establishments -</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-10 space-y-2">
          <li>That is a factory engaged in any industry having 20 or more people.</li>
          <li>An establishment employing 20 or more people or class of such establishments that the Central Government may specify on this behalf by notification.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The employer should obtain the registration within 1 month of attaining the strength, failing which penalties will be applicable. A registered establishment continues to be under the Act's purview even if the employee strength falls below the required minimum.</p>
        <p>The Central Government may apply the provisions to any establishment employing less than 20 employees after giving not less than two months' notice for compulsory registration.</p>
        <p>Where the employer and majority of employees have agreed that the provisions of this Act should be made applicable to the establishment, they may themselves apply to the Central PF Commissioner. The Central PF Commissioner may apply the provisions of this Act to that establishment after passing the notification in the Official Gazette from the date of such agreement or any subsequent date specified in the contract.</p>
        <p>Some establishments having less than 20 employees would also be required to obtain PF registration, but that is voluntary registration. All the employees will be eligible for a PF from the commencement of their employment. The responsibility of deduction & payment of PF lies with the employer.</p>
        <p>The PF contribution of 12% should be divided equally between the employer and employee. The employer's contribution is 12% of the basic salary. If the establishment has employed less than 20 employees, the PF deduction rate will be 10%.</p>
